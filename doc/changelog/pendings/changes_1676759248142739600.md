### How to upgrade

Motd is removed from config file

Motd is can now be found in auth database table `motd`

`realmid` = Realm ID or -1 for all realms.
`text` = Text for Motd

Specified realmId is prioritized over -1 (All Realms)

For example:

You have realm 1, 2, 3

(-1, "This Motd will show for 2, 3")
(1, "This Motd will show for 1")
